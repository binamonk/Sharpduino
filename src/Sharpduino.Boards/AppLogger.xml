            Turn the led off. If a led is strobing, it will not stop. Use Led.Stop().Off() to turn off a led while strobing.

            <summary>
             For interval operations, call stop to stop the interval. stop does not necessarily turn "off" the Led, in order to fully shut down an Led, a program must call stop().off(). This operation will only work with Leds attached to PWM pins.
